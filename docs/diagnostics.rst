Diagnostics
===========

The header ``<lorina/diagnostics.hpp>`` implements a mechanism to react on parse errors.

The `diagnostic engine` ``diagnostic_engine`` is used to emit diagnostics when a parsing algorithm encounters mistakes.  The possible error messages are specified by the implementation of the respective parsing algorithm.
